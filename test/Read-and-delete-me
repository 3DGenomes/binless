 Stan specific notes:
If you add any additional .stan files to the exec/ directory, 
be sure to add an entry in the RcppModules: line of DESCRIPTION.
You can put into inst/chunks/common_functions.txt any function that is needed by any .stan file, 
in which case any .stan file can have #include 'common_functions.txt' in its functions block.
The precompiled stanmodel objects will appear in a named list called 'stanmodels'.
The 'cleanup' and 'cleanup.win' scripts in the root of the directory must be made executable.
